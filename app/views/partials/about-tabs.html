              CDC estimates of flu-associated yearly deaths in the United States
              range from a low of about 3,000 to a high of about 49,000 people.

            <li>
              If you have the flu, you can infect others 1 day before showing
              symptoms and up to 7 days after becoming sick.
            </li>

            <li>
              The single best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu vaccine
              each season.

          <p>
            While important systems exist for reporting and tracking disease,
            they’re not perfect, missing those who don’t go to the doctor, and a
            bit slowly because it takes time for reports to be collected and sent
            to health departments.
          </p>

          <p>
            We believe that letting individuals report symptoms in real-time can
            complement traditional tracking while providing useful information
            directly to the public.

            Created by epidemiologists at Harvard, Boston Children’s Hospital and
            The Skoll Global Threats Fund, Flu Near You relies on voluntary
            participation from the general public, asking you to take a few
            seconds each week to report if you or your family members have been
            healthy or sick.
          </p>

          <p>
            We analyze thousands of reports and map them to generate local and
            national views of influenza-like illness, providing public health
            officials and researchers with real-time, anonymous information that
            could help prevent the next pandemic.
          </p>

          <p>
            With your help, we can all see what’s coming andbetter still- you
            have the knowledge to protect yourself and your family against disease.
