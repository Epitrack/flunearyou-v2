            CDC estimates of flu-associated yearly deaths in the United States
            range from a low of about 3,000 to a high of about 49,000 people.

          <li>
            If you have the flu, you can infect others 1 day before showing
            symptoms and up to 7 days after becoming sick.
          </li>

          <li>
            The single best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu vaccine
            each season.

      <h4>Early detection and early response are key to preventing the spread of any disease.</h4>
      <h5>Makes sense, but how do you detect disease outbreaks in real time?</h5>

      <div class="complementary">
        <p>
          While important systems exist for reporting and tracking disease,
          they’re not perfect, missing those who don’t go to the doctor, and a
          bit slowly because it takes time for reports to be collected and sent
          to health departments.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe that letting individuals report symptoms in real-time can
          complement traditional tracking while providing useful information
          directly to the public.

      <p>
        Created by epidemiologists at Harvard, Boston Children’s Hospital and
        The Skoll Global Threats Fund, Flu Near You relies on voluntary
        participation from the general public, asking you to take a few
        seconds each week to report if you or your family members have been
        healthy or sick.
      </p>

      <p>
        We analyze thousands of reports and map them to generate local and
        national views of influenza-like illness, providing public health
        officials and researchers with real-time, anonymous information that
        could help prevent the next pandemic.
      </p>

      <p>
        With your help, we can all see what’s coming and - better still- you
        have the knowledge to protect yourself and your family against disease.
